# Simple AI

This code uses the TensorFlow library to build a simple neural network that can be trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
The neural network consists of a sequence of layers, each with a certain number of units. 
The first layer has 256 units, the second has 128 units, and the third has 10 units, which is the number of classes in the MNIST dataset. 
The network uses the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss to train the model. After training for 5 epochs, the model is evaluated on the test set.
